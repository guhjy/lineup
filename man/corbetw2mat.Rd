\title{Calculate correlations between columns of two matrices}

\description{
  For matrices x and y, calculate the correlation between columns of x
  and columns of y.
}

\usage{
corbetw2mat(x, y, what=c("paired", "bestright", "bestpairs", "all"),
            corthresh=0.9)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{A numeric matrix.}
  \item{y}{A numeric matrix with the same number of rows as \code{x}.}
  \item{what}{Indicates which correlations to calculate and return.  See
    value, below.}
  \item{corthresh}{Threshold on correlations if
    \code{what="bestpairs"}.}
}

\details{
  Missing values (\code{NA}) are ignored, and we calculate the
  correlation using all complete pairs, as in \code{\link[stats]{cor}}
  with \code{use="pairwise.complete.obs"}.
}

\value{
  If \code{what="paired"}, the return value is a vector of correlations,
  between columns of \code{x} and the corresponding column of \code{y}.
  \code{x} and \code{y} must have the same number of columns.

  If \code{what="bestright"}, we return a matrix
  of size \code{ncol(x)} by \code{2}, with the \eqn{i}th row being the maximum 
  correlation between column \eqn{i} of \code{x} and a column of
  \code{y}, and then the \code{y}-column index with that correlation.
  (In case of ties, we give the first one.)

  If \code{what="bestpairs"}, we return a matrix
  with three columns, containing all pairs of columns (with one in
  \code{x} and one in \code{y}) with correlation \eqn{\ge} \code{corthresh}.
  Each row corresponds to a column pair, and contains the correlation
  and then the \code{x}- and \code{y}-column indices.

  If \code{what="all"}, the output is a matrix of size \code{ncol(x)} by
  \code{ncol(y)}, with all correlations between columns of \code{x} and
  columns of \code{y}.

# a variance matrix

D <- chol(V)

# simulate two correlated matrices

# the same with y columns shuffled
corbetw2mat(x, z)

# for each column x, find column of y with max correlation
corbetw2mat(x, y, what="bestright")

# the same with y columns shuffled 
corbetw2mat(x, z, what="bestright")


# all pairs of columns with correlation >= 0.6
corbetw2mat(x, y, what="bestpairs", corthresh=0.6)

# the same with y columns shuffled
