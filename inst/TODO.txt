"To do" list for R/lineup
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is intended to contain a list of additions and revisions
that are planned for the R/lineup package.

If you any additions or revisions to suggest, please send an email to
Karl Broman, <kbroman@biostat.wisc.edu>.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

o A function for making those pairs plots for a set of individuals
  from one or two tissues.

o bring the dist down to C

o maybe separate the calculation of correlated pairs (like
  calc.locallod) from the calculate of distance

o distep, and distgp, for phenotype data

o Add examples in help files (calc.locallod, disteg, etc.)
  ...likely a simulated example

o algorithm for using distances to make a decision about what is
  messed up (that is, what happened).  I guess separate the inference
  of errors from the correction of errors.
