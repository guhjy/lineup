"To do" list for R/lineup
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is intended to contain a list of additions and revisions
that are planned for the R/lineup package.

If you any additions or revisions to suggest, please send an email to
Karl Broman, <kbroman@biostat.wisc.edu>.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

o Big revisions to distee: 
    - move distance calculation down to C
    - revise example to take account of the new structure

o Big revisions to disteg:
    - If missing values: don't use those individuals to form
      classifier and don't make a prediction about them.
    - take the distance calculation down to C

o A function for making those pairs plots for a set of individuals
  from one or two tissues.

o Function to plot knn classifier info for a particular eQTL

o Another plot of distance matrix: image of dichotomized version of
  distance (some threshold as input, checking d.method to decide
  whether to color above or below threshold).

o As an option to summary.lineupdist, arrange the results so that the
  first has the closest pair and then try to find a match among the
  others, repeating until you can't find further ones, then print the
  next closest pair, to more clearly show A-B switches or chains like
  A-B-C-D-E-F-A.  Also, indicate if next individual was not measured
  or matches self?  Perhaps combine the two directions?  ("For which
  columns is this row the max correlation?")

o Why are there so many eQTL obs/inf mismatches?
  Perhaps weight the eQTL by their proportion of mismatches across all
  mice?

o distep, and distgp, for phenotype data

o Add examples in help files (calc.locallod, disteg, etc.)
  ...likely a simulated example

o algorithm for using distances to make a decision about what is
  messed up (that is, what happened).  I guess separate the inference
  of errors from the correction of errors.

o Include a vignette
