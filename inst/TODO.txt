"To do" list for R/lineup
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is intended to contain a list of additions and revisions
that are planned for the R/lineup package.

If you any additions or revisions to suggest, please send an email to
Karl Broman, <kbroman@biostat.wisc.edu>.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

o Add examples in help files (calc.locallod, disteg, etc.)
  ...likely a simulated example

o plot method for single distance measure

o algorithm for using distances to make a decision about what is
  messed up (that is, what happened).  I guess separate the inference
  of errors from the correction of errors.
